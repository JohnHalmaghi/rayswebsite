					Twenty-five years ago, I was born in Clovis, CA and lived there until I left for college. When I was ten, I decided that I was going to grow up to become a teacher because of the influence that my teachers had on me. I also knew I would attend San Diego State University, and boy was my ten-year-old self certain of these two decisions. My high-school self… not so much. However, lo and behold, I am now pursuing a teaching career after graduating from San Diego State University (Go Aztecs!). In college, I pledged and eventually became president of the sorority Alpha Delta Chi, through which I met my now-husband, who was in our brother fraternity on campus. We live happily in La Mesa, hoping to soon grow our family by one puppy and anticipating this next exciting year ahead of us.

				<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
				<ul class="address"> </ul>
				<p>
					Throughout my education, I have shifted my understanding of what it means to be an effective teacher. At first, I wanted to be a teacher who would present creative lessons each week, primarily because I thought that fun lessons in and of themselves would keep the students engaged and entertained, and partly because I thought it would make me a better teacher in the eyes of my students and peers. However, during my student teaching, I quickly learned that lesson plans do not include classroom and time management skills and not everything will go as perfectly as I envisioned. My students and peers will not necessarily think I am the best teacher for how clever and innovative the lessons are, because it is a collection of skills great teachers possess that make lessons work. Students are all unique and have their own challenges and joys which a great teacher will learn and adjust to accordingly. My current philosophy on teaching has included this necessary element. I believe that students have unique strengths and do not all learn in the same ways, so they should be taught and assessed through a variety of means. This is more easily accomplished when teachers work together and with their learning community.</p>
					<p>
					How I have learned about my students’ strengths and interests was through personality questions given at the beginning of the year. I asked any question I felt would help me understand how my students think and, hopefully, how they enjoy learning. While this questionnaire helped, I usually learned the most about my students throughout the school year. For example, during my final semester of student teaching I started to see that every time I or my master teacher used a video in a lesson, the students would all love it. Even students who often were inattentive in class were instead fixed on the video and remembered it well. As a result, I tried to include short, relevant videos in many of my lessons, whereas in another class I may not have chosen to do that.
					</p>
					<p>
					As for assessment of students, I believe differentiated assessment is crucial to measuring learning growth in a whole class setting. Some students are excellent test-takers and are truly able to show how much they have learned through traditional exams, but many students have a tough time expressing their knowledge of a subject with this method. I intend to use project-based assessment in my future classroom because it is versatile (meaning students could choose what kind of project to create), could be done in groups, and helps in assessment of students who may not speak or read English at a fluent level. This type of assessment could be done while in the midst of learning a topic, or summatively. I also intend to measure growth of student knowledge through continual assessment. 
					</p>
					<p>
					While I am able to identify student needs and assess their academic growth, I certainly value collaboration among colleagues to aid in these endeavors. Working as a team to present lessons based on state standards will be extremely beneficial to the entire grade level, because the teachers are helping each other be as prepared, knowledgable, and confident as possible every day. Speaking as a new educator, any aid and guidance given to me will help me be a better teacher for my students and a better employee for the school and district. 
					</p>
					<p>
					Knowing that I will someday be part of a learning community that includes my students, fellow teachers, parents, and administration makes me hopeful and excited because I will have a role in raising up the next generation. I understand the weight of my responsibility to teach students how to be effective learners first and foremost, but also how to be good citizens, athletes, artists, role models, and friends. Each student has a unique past and, therefore, a unique future, and I will strive to bring about opportunities that enlighten them of their talents and encourage them to have a love of learning.

				<h1>Experience</h1>
				<ul class="address"> </ul>
				<p>
					While at San Diego State University, my major was Liberal Studies with a focus in science. As required by California, I completed 45 hours of observation for my Early Field Experience in the La Mesa-Spring Valley and Santee School Districts while attending SDSU. It was beneficial to take part in reading groups, observe various types of classroom management strategies, and begin to understand how students learn best; however, most of my most valuable experience was gained through student teaching.
					</p>
					<p>
					I earned my preliminary multiple subject credential through Fresno State, and all of my student teaching was completed in Clovis Unified School District. Because I grew up in this district, it was easy to assimilate to the classrooms and refamiliarize myself with the district’s expectations of its students. The program was three semesters long, each semester in a different class and grade level. Semester 1 was spent mostly observing in a 4/5 combo class, but I often worked with small groups teaching reading and social studies lessons. Semester 2, I was assigned to a 1st grade class, in which I lead morning routine and taught many lessons on my own across multiple subjects. I gained experience in conducting case studies with an advanced student, an English learner, and a special needs student. My final semester, I worked in a 6th grade class, and it was incredibly immersive as I was in the classroom full-time. I took over the class for two weeks straight, with minimal assistance, and gained experience working with struggling readers and creating assessment plans. I also had the opportunity to attend their 6th grade camp.</p>
					<p>
					Since graduating, I have been subbing in various districts in the San Diego county, and observing in junior high and elementary school classrooms whenever I get the chance. It has been beneficial to be a substitute teacher as I have grown in my time management and classroom management skills, which was always a focus of mine in the credential program. I am still learning and know I will always have more to learn in this wonderful profession.

					<h3><b>Kay Davies: University Supervisor</b></h3>
					<b>Feb 2016</b> <br><br>

					<p>I had the opportunity and pleasure of supervising Melissa for her three semesters of student teaching at Fresno State University dating from August 2014 to December 2015.

					In the supervision of Melissa’s field experiences I observed very good progress in her teaching skills. She made continual growth in all of the California Standards for the Teaching Profession (CSTP’s). She writes aligned Common Core standards lesson plans and units of study. In her lessons she utilized a variety of strategies to include technology, visual aids, graphic organizers and teaching charts to provide support for students. She was continually seeking ways to develop a positive learning environment through a firm, fair, and consistent approach to student behavior management. She progressed in learning the importance of continuous and ongoing assessment to inform her instruction as well as know the acquired learning of each student. Through a collaborative effort she worked with her master teacher to provide a good learning environment in the classroom. She is definitely a team player. A particular strength of Melissa is her ability to reflect, adapt, change, and modify instruction based on her reflections. As a result, she made excellent progress in her teaching skills during the last semester, Additionally, Melissa is ethical, reliable, punctual, enthusiastic and hard working. 

					I enjoyed working with Melissa. She is a very conscientious future educator who will go above and beyond to do her best in the classroom, at the school, and for the district. I am confident that she will do well in her future endeavors as an educator.</p>


					<h3><b>Catherine Ziegler: Teacher at Maryland Avenue Elementary</b></h3>
					January 24, 2016</b><br><br>

					<p>It is with great pleasure that I recommend Melissa Larimore. She is responsible,
					bright, friendly, and organized. Melissa has wonderful enthusiasm for the teaching profession, and I know she will make an excellent teacher.

					Melissa completed her observation hours in my second grade classroom at
					Maryland Avenue Elementary School in La Mesa, California. The group she observed had 23 boys (!) and 8 girls, and was one of the more challenging and diverse in my 16 year career as a teacher. One of my students was a mainstreamed autistic child with behavioral and academic issues and a full-time aide, and five of my students were on daily medication for ADD or ADHD.

					Melissa came to my classroom eager to not only observe and learn, but to be a
					practicing educator in the classroom as well. I was pleasantly surprised with her
					willingness to actively engage with the students in their learning. Melissa gained
					valuable experience in this very diverse classroom. Whenever she was in my
					classroom, she willingly managed a reading group, happily gave one on help and small group instruction to students in writing and math, and charmed the students with her readalouds.

					While I was very impressed with the way Melissa proactively helped the students,
					I also noted that Melissa was comfortable with classroom management. She was
					patient and kind; at the same time she encouraged students to raise their hands, pay attention, and act respectfully.

					I am very confident that Melissa Larimore will be an outstanding asset to the
					teaching profession, and once again, it is my pleasure to recommend her.</p>


					<h3><b>Caroline Sherburne: Science Teacher at STEAM Academy at La Presa</b></h3>
					February 5, 2017</b><br><br>
					<p>I would like to recommend Melissa Halmaghi for a teaching position at your school. Melissa has been a regular, dependable substitute teacher for my middle school classes, and she has shown great organizational and classroom management skills. Several other teachers have commented on her professional and confident control over the class in my absence, and she has developed rapport with the students so that they know what to expect and how to behave under her teaching. Her skills are much more developed than most substitutes and first-year teachers, and I am confident that she will be able to handle her own classroom in the same consistent manner.
					On a more personal level, Melissa is a caring person who has great skills connecting with kids. She truly wants to help students learn, and has a great balance between knowledge of subject matter and approachability. Melissa’s calm nature is perfect for dealing with any stressful situations she might encounter, and for being a source of support and compassion for her students.
					Melissa is committed to growing as a professional, and she is willing to take advice and learn from the experience of others. At the same time, she has many good ideas of her own, and will be a strong addition to your school’s team of teachers.</p>
