					My name is Ray Blair. I am 36 years old married to my beautiful wife Jen, And we have 3 great but crazy kids ages 8, 6 , 4. I was born in San Diego, CA and lived there most of my life. I was not raised in a christian home. Parents divorced when I was 9 and eventually became a high school drop out, choosing the party and drug life. But when I was 19 God opened my eyes through a series of events to my need of Him and the truth and power of the bible. I surrendered my life at that point and hit the ground running. I was seemingly instantly a new creation in Christ and born again. God began changing me from the inside out and became almost unrecognizable to those who knew me before. Within my first year as a christian I enrolled in a missions/evangelism school and was immersed in the bible and christian community. I was immediately evangelizing and going on countless missions trips. by age 22 I had sold what little possessions I had to walk by faith as a missionary in Mexico. I began a young adult ministry and had 30+ attending the bible study in Puerto Vallarta Mexico. I soon realized my need to know more of Gods word and felt it was time to move back for personal growth. I attended a bible college but was discontent with how difficult they made the bible out to be. So I dropped out and began studying chapter and verse book by book doing exegesis. I made use of many bible tools to aid my study of the original languages, and to help me in my studying of Gods word. While still doing short term missions trips I began to lead a home bible study for young adults. It was then I found my passion for personal discipleship. It has now been 12 years since I have been doing personal discipleship and have seen these men become Pastors, church planters, and leaders in their churches doing the same type of ministry. God has used this introverted boy and turned Him into a man who has a passion to speak Gods word to as many people as possible. I have had the joy of preaching and serving in various pastoral roles during this time, but my greatest joy is to disciple and minister to individuals. To help people Know God and to make Him known. My heart is to love God with all I am and to live in enjoyment of constant fellowship and communion with Him. I have since obtained a bachelors in theology and have been ordained by a Southern Baptist Church.

				<h1>Doctrinal Beliefs</h1>
				<ul class="address"> </ul>
				<p>
				<b>Bible:</b> We believe that the Bible (Old and New Testament, 66 books) is the inspired  Word  of God (plenary, verbal) and wholly without error in the original manuscripts(inerrancy). The Bible alone is the very word of God and is the final authority on all issues.   (2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>God:</b> We believe that there is one true God who has revealed Himself in the Trinity. He has revealed Himself through the Scriptures as the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is one God with three distinct persons equal in perfection and eternality, and all three are one God. (Deuteronomy 6:4; Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 8:6)
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Jesus Christ:</b> We believe that Jesus Christ of Nazareth is the second person of the Trinity. He is the eternal Word and only begotten Son. He is eternally God but became a man by the miracle of the virgin birth. He thus became “Emmanuel” (God with us), the perfect God-Man. He is fully God and fully man.  He was sinless, He died on the cross of Calvary to pay for the sins of the world and rose again three days later to give eternal life to all who would repent and put their complete trust in Him for salvation. (Colossians 1:15; Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 4:14-16; Revelation 11:15-17; 20:4-6, 11-15)
				Holy Spirit: We believe that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity; that He convicts the world of sin, righteousness and judgment; and draws men and women to Christ for salvation by prevenient grace and that He gives believers spiritual gifts to be exercised by the believers to edify and exhort the body of Christ, which is the church. (1 Corinthians 2:10-11; Hebrews 3:7-9)
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Man:</b> We believe in the distinctiveness of man to rule over the entire God-created earth. God created man alone in His image on the sixth literal day of creation. Though created perfect, man has sinned and as a result brought death and sin into his nature. All men have sinned by nature and by choice, are sinful and lost, and are in need of salvation.  (Genesis 1:26-28; Romans 3:10)
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Salvation:</b> We believe that salvation is by God’s grace alone through faith in the finished work of Christ on the cross of Calvary. Salvation is a free gift from God, neither earned nor secured by good behavior or good works, and it can only be secured through personal repentance and faith in the person and work of Jesus Christ. All who believe are given eternal life in the presence of God forever, all who reject the gospel will be cast into the lake of fire where they will suffer eternal conscious torment away from the presence of God. (John 3:16; Ephesians 2:8-9, Revelation 21-22)
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Church:</b> We believe that the Church is comprised of all believers baptized by the Holy Spirit at the moment of salvation and thus born again (regardless of Christian denomination). The Church’s mission is to be Gods representatives on earth and teach believers God’s truth for living and to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ to all people. The Church’s ordinances are Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. (Ephesians 4:10-12; Matthew 28:19; 1 Corinthians 11:23-29, 12:13)
				Israel: We believe that God called a people to Himself who are the physical descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; that Israel is the Wife of Jehovah, unfaithful in the past, divorced in the present, and to be reunited in the future; that God has made covenants with this elect nation that have remained unfulfilled; that God intends to fulfill all His promises to Israel in a literal way just as His warnings and judgments were fulfilled in a literal way; that in Israel's history of unbelief there has always been a believing remnant according to the election of grace; that there will be a national regeneration of Israel at which time all of the provisions of the unconditional covenants will be fulfilled, including the seed, land, and blessing aspects. 
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Second Coming:</b> We believe in the Second Coming of Jesus Christ and that His coming, which is our blessed hope, is always imminent at which time He will take His saints with Him( rapture),and bring His judgments upon the earth( the great tribulation) after which He will bring His saints with Him and then establish His kingdom on earth for a thousand years and thus fulfill all His promises specifically given to Israel, after the thousand years will be the great white throne judgments in which all unbelievers will be judged and thrown in the lake of fire. And then He will establish a new heaven and a new earth. (2 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Revelation 20-22)
				</p>
				<p>
				<b>Bible Interpretation:</b> We believe the literal, grammatical, historical interpretation of the bible is best and an over spiritualizing and an explaining away of the clear meaning of scripture is dangerous.

				<h1>Ministry Experience</h1>
				<ul class="address"> </ul>
				<p>
				I have had the opportunity to minister in a variety of roles from church janitor to Pastor. I have had the opportunity to share my story of salvation and the gospel many times in the United states and Mexico in jails, rehabs, youth groups, skateparks and churches. I was able to help plant a church in Guaymas Mexico and was first to preach there in 2003. Also helped plant a church in Portobello Scotland with a missions team in 2004. I have led various bible study groups at homes and even coffee shops teaching thru books of the bible for 12 years from 2004-currently. During the course of 12 years I have served as Lay Pastor preaching a handful of times a year at Horizon Coast Chapel. At Crest Community Church I served on staff as an Associate Pastor teaching an adult Sunday evening service. And served as Youth Pastor teaching 2 times a week to Jr. high and high school students. I did a Pastoral internship in 2006 for a year and a half serving in a pastoral care office doing biblical counseling at Horizon Christian Fellowship. I am currently an on call Pastor to preach for a couple churches and do so occasionally. I have served twice in churches assisting the lead Pastor as he stepped into his new Pastorate . I have even helped another church during a difficult season of losing a Pastor and stood in the gap until a new Pastor came in. I have written a doctrinal statement for a home church plant and recently have written by-laws for the Church I am currently serving as Associate Pastor. I am currently teaching twice a week at Trinity Baptist Church and writing curriculum for the adult Sunday school, And preaching from the pulpit occasionally. Most importantly I have had the joy of personally discipling a handful of men who have become Pastors, church planters, worship leaders and leaders in their churches and they are now doing the same type of personal discipleship. To God be all the glory, without Him I can do nothing. "There are many who preach Christ, not many who live Christ. My great aim is to live Christ."-R.C.Chapman
